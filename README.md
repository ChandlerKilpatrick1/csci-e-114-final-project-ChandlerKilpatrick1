# Final Project

Running my site is very simple, while it connects to an API, no API key is needed. 

1: Download the necessary packages by installing Node.js and npm.
2: Then use the "npm install" command. This downloads or updates the necessary packages. 

3: Now type "npm start" in the terminal of the root directory and the project should run.
